# MultiTech Conduit TTN Installer

The detailed instructions are available at the [TTN documentation](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/current/multitech/).
These instructions are based on the 'old' Poly Packet Forwarder but still largely applicable. (There will be a slight difference
in the prompts for information)

To use the 'old' Poly Packet Forwarder, use poly_installer.sh
For the new Multi Protocol Packet Forwarder use 'installer.sh"
